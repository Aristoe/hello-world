# hello-world

Hola humanos

currently learning spanish as well as some other languages like python, SQL, and Javascript. Also interested in KahnAcademy's
cryptography and algorithm courses as well as several other things in the realm of CS. New stuff is awesome. Love math and physics
but philosophy and theology even more!
